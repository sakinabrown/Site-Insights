# Site-Insights
This is a Final Project I worked on in my MS Business Analytics program
Site Insights is meant to use Historic and Predicted Flight prices to help businesses decide on a New location. This is just proof of concept since more information would be needed to use what was created.
We narrowed the predicted information to Hartsfield Jackson Airport.
